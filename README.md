# Cisco Packet Tracer Labs (CCNA)

This repository contains my personal Cisco Packet Tracer lab practice while studying for the CCNA certification.

All lab scenarios in this repository are based on content from Jeremy’s IT Lab (YouTube), which I am following as my primary learning resource.  
I recreated and configured each lab myself to practice and strengthen my networking skills.

All configuration files, verification outputs, screenshots, and explanations are my own work.
